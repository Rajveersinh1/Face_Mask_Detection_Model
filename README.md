# Face_Mask_Detection_Model

This repository contains a face mask detection model implemented using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of images containing people with and without masks, and is able to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time video streams.

The model is built using Python and utilizes the OpenCV and TensorFlow libraries. The implementation includes scripts for training the model on your own dataset, as well as a pre-trained model that can be used for inference.

To use the pre-trained model, simply download the repository and run the detect_facemask_video.py script. The script will use your device's camera to detect faces and whether or not they are wearing masks, and display the video stream with bounding boxes and labels.

This model can be used for a variety of applications, including enforcing mask-wearing policies in public spaces, monitoring compliance in workplaces, and more. Feel free to contribute to this repository by improving the model's accuracy, adding new features, or using it for your own projects.
